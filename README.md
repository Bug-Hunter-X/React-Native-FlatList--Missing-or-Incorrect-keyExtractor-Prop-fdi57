This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component: the absence or incorrect use of the `keyExtractor` prop.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, resulting in unpredictable rendering. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the correct implementation, highlighting the importance of a unique key for each item in the list to ensure optimal performance and accurate rendering.  This is a critical aspect for developers working with large datasets or complex list structures.
