The solution involves correctly implementing the `keyExtractor` prop within the FlatList component.  This prop should provide a unique key for each item in the data array.  A common and efficient approach is to use the item's unique identifier, like an ID from an API response.  If no unique identifier exists, you can generate one using a library or a custom function. Below is an example: 

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

In this example, each item's `id` is used to generate a unique key.  Make sure this ID is indeed unique for each item.  If you're using a simple array of strings or numbers, you can use the index as a key as a last resort, but this is less efficient and can cause problems with list reordering or updates.
